# T14 1.0 by Gavin Kendall

# This is a simple text file used to test the functionality of the T14 interpreted language.
# This is a comment and should be ignored by the parser.

# The next line is an example of setting a variable with a value. The type isn't specified. The parser should figure it out.
::set $foo-Bar = hello

# Here's a number.
::set $My_number = 123

# Tabs and new lines shouldn't appear
		



# The next line is standard output of a variable's value.
Let's output the value of the foo-Bar variable as $foo-Bar

# Output the other variable
Let's see what happens with the My_number variable value of $My_number (does it show a number?)

# Output 1234567 into its hexadecimal equivalent.
This is 1234567 in hexadecimal ...
::dec->hex(1234567)

# Output 1234567 into its binary equivalent.
This is 1234567 in binary ...
::dec->bin(1234567)
